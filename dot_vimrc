" Description: A minimal, but feature rich, example .vimrc. If you are a
"              newbie, basing your first .vimrc on this file is a good choice.
"              If you're a more advanced user, building your own .vimrc based
"              on this file is still a good idea.
"------------------------------------------------------------
" Features 
"
" These options and commands enable some very useful features in Vim, that
" no user should have to live without.
" Set 'nocompatible' to ward off unexpected things that your distro might
" have made, as well as sanely reset options when re-sourcing .vimrc
set nocompatible

" set for vundle
filetype off                        " required

" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim    " required
call vundle#begin()                 " required
" alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
" call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

" let Vundle manage Vundle, required
Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'          " required

" Keep Plugin commands between vundle#begin/end
" Plugin from git repo: https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe
Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'

" Plugin for solarized colorscheme
Plugin 'altercation/vim-colors-solarized'

" Plugin for linting C++
Plugin 'scrooloose/syntastic'

" Plugin for using grep within vim
Plugin 'mhinz/vim-grepper'

" Plugin for handling git within vim
Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'

" All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
call vundle#end()                   " required

" Attempt to determine the type of a file based on its name and possibly its
" contents. Use this to allow intelligent auto-indenting for each filetype,
" and for plugins that are filetype specific.
filetype indent plugin on           " required
" To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:
"filetype plugin on                 " required
"
" Brief help
" :PluginList       - lists configured plugins
" :PluginInstall    - installs plugins; append `!` to update or just
"                     :PluginUpdate
" :PluginSearch foo - searches for foo; append `!` to refresh local cache
" :PluginClean      - confirms removal of unused plugins; append `!` to
"                     auto-approve removal
" 
" see :h vundle for more details or wiki for FAQ
" Put your non-Plugin stuff after this line

"------------------------------------------------------------
" Must have options 
"
" These are highly recommended options.

" Vim with default settings does not allow easy switching between multiple files
" in the same editor window. Users can use multiple split windows or multiple
" tab pages to edit multiple files, but it is still best to enable an option to
" allow easier switching between files.

" One such option is the 'hidden' option, which allows you to re-use the same
" window and switch from an unsaved buffer without saving it first. Also allows
" you to keep an undo history for multiple files when re-using the same window
" in this way. Note that using persistent undo also lets you undo in multiple
" files even in the same window, but is less efficient and is actually designed
" for keeping undo history after closing Vim entirely. Vim will complain if you
" try to quit without saving, and swap files will keep you safe if your computer
" crashes.
set hidden
" Note that not everyone likes working this way (with the hidden option).
" Alternatives include using tabs or split windows instead of re-using the same
" window as mentioned above, and/or either of the following options:
" set confirm
" set autowriteall

" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on
" Better command-line completion
set wildmenu
" Show partial commands in the last line of the screen
set showcmd
" Highlight searches (use <C-L> to temporarily turn off highlighting; see the
" mapping of <C-L> below)
set hlsearch
" Modelines have historically been a source of security vulnerabilities. As
" such, it may be a good idea to disable them and use the securemodelines
" script, <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1876>.
" set nomodeline


"------------------------------------------------------------
" Usability options 
"
" These are options that users frequently set in their .vimrc. Some of them
" change Vim's behaviour in ways which deviate from the true Vi way, but
" which are considered to add usability. Which, if any, of these options to
" use is very much a personal preference, but they are harmless.

" Use case insensitive search, except when using capital letters
set ignorecase
set smartcase
" Allow backspacing over autoindent, line breaks and start of insert action
set backspace=indent,eol,start
" When opening a new line and no filetype-specific indenting is enabled, keep
" the same indent as the line you're currently on. Useful for READMEs, etc.
set autoindent
" Stop certain movements from always going to the first character of a line.
" While this behaviour deviates from that of Vi, it does what most users
" coming from other editors would expect.
set nostartofline
" Display the cursor position on the last line of the screen or in the status
" line of a window
set ruler
" Always display the status line, even if only one window is displayed
set laststatus=2
" Instead of failing a command because of unsaved changes, instead raise a
" dialogue asking if you wish to save changed files.
set confirm
" Use visual bell instead of beeping when doing something wrong
set visualbell
" And reset the terminal code for the visual bell. If visualbell is set, and
" this line is also included, vim will neither flash nor beep. If visualbell
" is unset, this does nothing.
set t_vb=
" Set the command window height to 2 lines, to avoid many cases of having to
" "press <Enter> to continue"
set cmdheight=2
" Display line numbers on the left
set number
" Quickly time out on keycodes, but never time out on mappings
set notimeout ttimeout ttimeoutlen=200
" Use <F11> to toggle between 'paste' and 'nopaste'
set pastetoggle=<F11>


"------------------------------------------------------------
" Indentation options 
"
" Indentation settings according to personal preference.

" Indentation settings for using 2 spaces instead of tabs.
" Do not change 'tabstop' from its default value of 8 with this setup.
set shiftwidth=2
set softtabstop=2
set expandtab
" Indentation settings for using hard tabs for indent. Display tabs as
" two characters wide.
set shiftwidth=2
set tabstop=2


"------------------------------------------------------------
" Mappings 
"
" Useful mappings
" Map Y to act like D and C, i.e. to yank until EOL, rather than act as yy,
" which is the default
"map Y y$
"
" Map ctrl-I to clang formatting
"
" :function FormatFile()
" :  let l:lines="all"
" :  pyf ~/.vim/clang-format.py
" :endfunction
" map <C-I> :call FormatFile()<cr>
" imap <C-I> <c-o>:call FormatFile()<cr>


" Map <C-L> (redraw screen) to also turn off search highlighting until the
" next search
"nnoremap <C-L>'a0:nohl<CR><C-L>

"------------------------------------------------------------}
" Visual Elements
"
" Create a color column at 80 character width
set colorcolumn=80
" Setup solorized color scheme
syntax enable
set background=dark
" Force terminal colors to 256.
set t_Co=256
colorscheme solarized
" Set toggle color command (between nighttime and daytime).
call togglebg#map("<F5>")

" YouCompleteMe Config
"
" Set this for compilation flags
let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf='~/.vim/ycm_config/cpp/.ycm_extra_conf.py'

" Grepper Config
"
" Use :Grepper to open a prompt, enter your query, optionally cycle through
" list of tools, fire up the search.
" Use the current visual selection to pre-fill the prompt or start searching
" immediately.
" Use :GrepperGit, :GrepperAg, etc.. to grep with different tools built on top
" of :Grepper. (:GrepperGit is for `git grep`)
" See more examples here:
" https://github.com/mhinz/vim-grepper/wiki/example-configurations-and-mappings
"
" Can fill out a map of grepper setttings here or set them one by one below.
let g:grepper = {}
"
" Enable git grep and regular grep as grepping tools.
let g:grepper.tools = ['git', 'grep']
" Use grepper to jump to the first result that pops up in the current window.
" let g:grepper.jump = 1
" let g:grepper.next_tool = '<leader>g'
" let g:grepper.simple_prompt = 1
" let g:grepper.quickfix = 0
"
" This defines an |operator| "gs" that takes any |{motion}| and uses that
" selection to populate the search prompt. The query is quoted automatically.
" In visual mode, it uses the current selection.
nmap gs  <plug>(GrepperOperator)
xmap gs  <plug>(GrepperOperator)

"------------------------------------------------------------}
" Fugitive Config
"
" View any blob, tree, commit, or tag in the git repo with :Gedit (and
" :Gsplit, :Gvsplit, :Gtabedit, ...). Edit a file in the index and write
" to it to stage the changes. Use :Gdiff to bring up the staged version of the
" file side by side with the working tree version with vimdiff. Bring up
" git status with :Gstatus. Press `-` to add/reset a file's changes, or `p` to
" add/reset `--patch`. :Gcommit to commit. Use :Gblame to vsplit a git blame.
" :Gmove does git mv and renames teh buffer, and :Gdelete does git rm and
" deletes the file. Use :Ggrep to search teh work tree (or any arbitrary
" commit) with `git grep`. :Glog loads all previous revisions of a file into
" the quickfix list for iteration through the file's evolutions. Use :Gbrowse
" to open the web front-end for github with optional line range specified by
" visual highlights! :Git for running any arbitrary command, and :Git! will
" open the output of the command in a temp file.
